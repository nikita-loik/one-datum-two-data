Looking for a new job is a full-time, unpaid, often exhausting, and sometimes humiliating job of its own. Occasionally, one may be in some luck to be hunted by a skillful headhunter, who does not treat an applicant as game, but instead turns the process into a rewarding game not matter the outcome. In the last two years I have been in touch with over 83 headhunters (83 are the ones I managed to keep the records of).

Overtime, certain criteria on which to judge whether the headhunter is not too old to hunt precipitate out.


Good headhunters just make the game crystal-clear to you:
1. clear information about the salary & the job(s):
* responsibilities & requirements
* product
* company

2. clear information about the interview process:
* duration of the process
* stages involved
* 
3. clear detailed feedback on every part of the interview (whether successful or not)

Regrettably, I failed to respond when approached by 4 headhunters (4.8x%). At the same time there were 15 headhunters (18.1%) who never came back to me after my responding to their original advances and sending them my CV — those were duly deleted from my network.

Brilliant headhunters add a personal touch to the game:
1. they can negotiate an interview process for you
* order of the interviews (*e.g.* to have tech-task after personal interviews, so that you don't waste time doing the task when you already lost points in the most-charming-smile contest)
* tech-task content (*e.g.* sometimes they can negotiate you out of spending hours or even days on a tech-task by substituting it with code-along discussion or reviewing of your open-source projects)
2. they can communicate back to the company your issues with tech-tasks (sometimes those are shitty by design), or your decision not to move forward with the application
3. they offer a life-long support
* when your company goes bust
* when you move to another country
* when you want to change the company


they provide you with wealth of information about the company and the

Only five headhunters made the cut 


When looking for a right company, you would like to cut through the thick fleshy bullshit right to the core — basically you want to know (1) what they do, and (2) how much they pay.

Lamentably, the tech stack found in job descriptions is often obscure as hell. It can be anything from extremely generic ('data scientist with good knowledge in any programming language'), to highly specific ('data scientist with a proven track record of model simplification'), to completely grotesque ('data scientist with wealth of experience in data visualisation and kubernetes').

In addition from the outside the absolute majority of companies look exactly the same. They offer the flat hierarchy (what ever this oxymoronic misnomer might mean), the pay above average (which turn the concept of average into some escheresque paradox), an awesome office location, and a fruit basket (a cookie jar, an ergonomic chair, assortment of fizzy drinks).

A good head hunter will tell you exactly what you get:
