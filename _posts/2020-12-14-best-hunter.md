Looking for a new job is a full-time, unpaid, often exhausting, and sometimes humiliating job of its own. Occasionally, one may be in some luck to be hunted by a skillful headhunter, who does not treat an applicant as game, but instead turns the process into a rewarding game, no matter the outcome. In the last two years I have been in touch with over 83 headhunters (83 are only the ones I managed to keep the records of).

Overtime, certain criteria on which to judge whether the headhunter is not too old to hunt precipitate out. Good headhunters just make the game crystal-clear to you and provided the following information up front:
1. the salary & the job(s) including:
* responsibilities & requirements
* product
* company

2. the interview process:
* duration of the process
* stages involved

3. clear detailed feedback on every part of the interview (whether successful or not).

Particularly weird specimens included:
* one who tried to get from me personal contact details of my colleague — this is just a no go,
* another who wanted me to fill in some endless forms on the website of the prospective employer — honestly if one wants to fill in the forms on their own they are already doing it.

Brilliant headhunters add a personal touch to the game:
1. they can negotiate an interview process for you
* order of the interviews (*e.g.* to have tech-task after personal interviews, so that you don't waste time doing the task when you already lost points in the most-charming-smile contest)
* tech-task content (*e.g.* sometimes they can negotiate you out of spending hours or even days on a tech-task by substituting it with code-along discussion or reviewing of your open-source projects)
2. they can communicate back to the company your issues with tech-tasks (sometimes those are shitty by design), or your decision not to move forward with the application
3. they offer a life-long support
* when your company goes bust
* when you move to another country
* when you want to change the company

Only 4 out of 83 (less than 5%) turned out to fall into this category. Here are the details of those, worth adding to your LinkedIn network.
