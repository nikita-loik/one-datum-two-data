Looking for a new job is a full-time, unpaid, often exhausting, and sometimes humiliating job of its own. Occasionally, one may be in some luck to be hunted by a skillful headhunter, who does not treat an applicant as game, but instead turns the process into a rewarding game, no matter the outcome. In the last two years I have been in touch with over 83 headhunters (83 are only the ones I managed to keep the records of).

Overtime, certain criteria on which to judge whether the headhunter is not too old to hunt precipitate out. Good headhunters just make the game crystal-clear to you:
1. clear information about the salary & the job(s) including:
* responsibilities & requirements
* product
* company

2. clear information about the interview process:
* duration of the process
* stages involved

3. clear detailed feedback on every part of the interview (whether successful or not).

Regrettably, I failed to respond when approached by 4 headhunters (5%). At the same time there were 15 headhunters (18%) who never came back to me after my responding to their original advances and sending them my CV — those were duly deleted from my network. 22 (27%) headhunters failed to provide any information on the job. 25 (30%) only provided the job description and requirements; something that can be found through on-line job portals — not quite clear what these people really contribute to the process. 17 (20%) provided detailed information about both the job and the salary.

Brilliant headhunters add a personal touch to the game:
1. they can negotiate an interview process for you
* order of the interviews (*e.g.* to have tech-task after personal interviews, so that you don't waste time doing the task when you already lost points in the most-charming-smile contest)
* tech-task content (*e.g.* sometimes they can negotiate you out of spending hours or even days on a tech-task by substituting it with code-along discussion or reviewing of your open-source projects)
2. they can communicate back to the company your issues with tech-tasks (sometimes those are shitty by design), or your decision not to move forward with the application
3. they offer a life-long support
* when your company goes bust
* when you move to another country
* when you want to change the company

Only ... out of 83 (less than 5%) turned out to fall into this category.
