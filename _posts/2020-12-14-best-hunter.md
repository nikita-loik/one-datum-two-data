In the last two years I have been in touch with well over 63 headhunters (it only includes the ones I managed to keep the records of and with whom I had at least the minimal introductory message exchange).

1. clear information about the company including their team and product they are trying to develop;
2. information on salary range the company is ready to offer and what they expect of a candidate to offer them the highest pay;

In addition from the outside the absolute majority of companies look exactly the same. They offer the flat hierarchy (what ever this oxymoronic misnomer might mean), the pay above average (which turn the concept of average into some escheresque paradox), an awesome office location, and a fruit basket (a cookie jar, an ergonomic chair, assortment of fizzy drinks).
