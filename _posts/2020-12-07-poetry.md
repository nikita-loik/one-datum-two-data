## Prerequisits
Set-up macOS and install `pyenv` as described in [PIP my Env](https://nikita-loik.github.io/one-datum-two-data/blog/pip-my-env).
Set global version of python using `pyenv`.
```sh
pyenv global #.#.#
```

## Virtualenv Installation & Use
```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
source $HOME/.poetry/env
poetry --version
```
Examples of the scripts and the Makefile are provided in [dummy/poetry_test](https://github.com/nikita-loik/dummy/tree/main/poetry_test).

|file|function|
|:-:|:-:|
|[get_poetryenv.sh](https://github.com/nikita-loik/dummy/blob/main/poetry_test/get_poetryenv.sh)|creates python virtual environment using poetry|
|[Makefile](https://github.com/nikita-loik/dummy/blob/main/poetry_test/Makefile)|contains make commands to get and remove virtual environment|
|[test.py](https://github.com/nikita-loik/dummy/blob/main/poetry_test/test.py)|imports installed libraries, and reports whether the imports were successful|

**NB!** To make script executable, it may be necessary to change the [mode of the file][chmod-tutorial]:

```sh
chmod +x get_poetryenv.sh
```

To install virtual environment, run:
```sh

```
To test the installation was successful, run:
