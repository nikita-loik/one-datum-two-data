This article arose from pain and misery of having to switch from one python-package managing to another.

Tested on macOS Big Sur (version 11.0.1).


## 1. Prerequisits

### 1.1 Install XCODE or XCODE-beta
Install those from [Apple-Developer Website](https://developer.apple.com/download/). 

Run `xcode-select --install`.

### 1.2 Install & Upgrade HOMEBREW
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
Run `brew upgrade && brew update`.

### 1.3 Install Python DEPENDENCIES
```sh
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib gdbm bzip2
```

Some of those dependency libraries are [keg-only](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#what-does-keg-only-mean). macOS already provides some of them and "installing another version in parallel can cause all kinds of trouble".

Add PATH to libraries in your `~/.zshrc` file.
```sh
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/zlib/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bzip2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

For compilers to find `zlib`, `bzip2`, and `openssl` run:
```sh
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/bzip2/lib -L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"

export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/bzip2/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
```

### 5. Install PYENV
Run `brew install pyenv`.

To access the pyenv command-line utility, set an environment variable (PYENV_ROOT) to point to the pyenv directory.
```sh
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
So that the OS finds pyenvâ€™s Python(s) before any other Pythons, run:
```sh
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
To (1) initialise pyenv each time you open a terminal and (2) to enable shims and autocompletion add `pyenv init` to your shell. Please make sure eval "$(pyenv init -)" is placed toward the end of the shell configuration file since it manipulates PATH during the initialisation.
```sh
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
```
### 6. Install Relevant PYTHON VERSION
To check which versions are available, run `pyenv install --list`.
Install desired version `pyenv install 3.8.6`.
Set version as global `pyenv global 3.8.6`.
