This article arose from the pain and misery of having to switch from one python-package managing tool to another. It focuses on 
1. how to set-up macOS and pyenv (current chapter)
2. [virtualenv](https://nikita-loik.github.io/one-datum-two-data/blog/virtualenv)
3. [pipenv](https://nikita-loik.github.io/one-datum-two-data/blog/pipenv/)
4. [poetry](https://nikita-loik.github.io/one-datum-two-data/blog/poetry/)

While very effective as a tool, it can be fairly laborious to create [python virtual environments][hitchhikers-guide-virtual-environments] for every project on every computer. To simplify this tedious task simple shell scripts combined with [makefiles][exhaustive-make-reference] are described in parts 2, 3, and 4 for virtualenv, pipenv, and poetry, respectively. These parts are independent of one another, but are dependent upon settings suggested in current chapter.

To assist with the set-up and to provide a playground for creating and destroying virtual environments [dummy project](https://github.com/nikita-loik/dummy) was created. Feel free to clone it, play with it, and make any suggestions on how to improve it.

## Set up macOS
This is a way to set up your Mac such that you can avoid its unpleasant behaviour.

The complete set-up can be found in (this script)[https://github.com/nikita-loik/notes/blob/master/set_up_mac.sh].

Solutions have been tested on macOS Big Sur (version 11.1).

## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 Install XCODE or XCODE-beta
Install those from [Apple-Developer Website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/). 

Run `xcode-select --install`.

### 1.2 Install & Upgrade HOMEBREW
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
Run `brew upgrade && brew update`.

## 2. Install PYENV
* most concise [pyenv introduction](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* [pyenv commands](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md) and how to use them
* somewhat wordy [pyenv tutorial](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)

Run `brew install pyenv`.

To access the pyenv command-line utility, run:
```sh
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
For OS to find pyenvâ€™s Python(s) before any other Pythons, run:
```sh
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
To (1) initialise pyenv each time you open a terminal and to (2) enable shims and autocompletion run:
```sh
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## 3. Install Python Dependencies
```sh
brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib gdbm bzip2
```

Some of those dependency libraries are [keg-only](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#what-does-keg-only-mean). Most likely, macOS already provides some of them and "installing another version in parallel can cause all kinds of trouble".

Add PATH to libraries in your `~/.zshrc` file:
```sh
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/zlib/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bzip2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

For compilers to find `zlib`, `bzip2`, and `openssl` run:
```sh
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/bzip2/lib -L/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib"

export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/bzip2/include -I/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/include"
```

## 4. Set LANG
Edit relevant section in `~/.zshrc`, or run the following:
```sh
echo 'export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## 5. Install Python Version
To check which versions are available, run `pyenv install --list`.

Install desired version `pyenv install #.#.#`.

Set version as global `pyenv global #.#.#`.
